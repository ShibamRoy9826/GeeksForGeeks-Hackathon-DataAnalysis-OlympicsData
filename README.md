# Olympics Medals Analysis

## Project Overview
This data analysis project delves into the historical records of Olympic Games from 1896 to 2022. The primary objective is to explore and analyze the distribution of medals won by various countries over the years. The project was conducted as part of a competition organized by GeeksforGeeks (GFG).

## Team Members
- Shibam Roy: Data Analyst
- Swadhin: Data Analyst
- Debdutta Burman: Frontend Dev
- Ankush Roy: Presentation Expert

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning: The dataset was thoroughly cleaned to remove inconsistencies and errors.
- Data Exploration: Initial exploratory data analysis was performed to uncover general trends.
- Data Visualization: Various visualization techniques were used to present findings effectively.
- Statistical Analysis: Statistical methods were employed to identify correlations and patterns.

## Key Findings
- Top Performing Countries: Identified countries consistently winning the most medals.(Out of which USA had the most medals of all types)
- Medal Type Distribution: Analyzed the distribution of Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals among top-performing countries.
- Correlation of Country population and Country location with Amount of medals
  
## Conclusion
This analysis provided valuable insights into the historical performance of countries in the Olympic Games. It sheds light on dominant countries and medal type distributions, contributing to a deeper understanding of Olympic success factors.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is mainly sourced from GeeksForGeeks. It covers Olympic medal data from 1896 to 2022.
For further data analysis, we used a dataset from kaggle, click<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset"> here </a>to check it out.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to GeeksforGeeks (GFG) for organizing the competition and providing the opportunity to work on this exciting project.
